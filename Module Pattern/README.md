# The Module Pattern

This pattern was defined as a way to provide both private and public encapsulation for classes in software development.

## JavaScript

In JavaScript, this pattern is used to emulate the concept of private and public encapsulation.
In TypeScript we can set a property on a class to be private when we compile that code to JavaScript we can see that those properties are still public.
In modern JavaScript we have classes with private properties. But in reality classes are just a syntactic description for a regular object, only meant to help readability of the code.
This is were the Module Pattern comes in handy, since it has all the possibilities of a class and its more compatible with Functional Programming.
